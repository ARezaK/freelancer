This notice does not grant any immigration status or benefit, nor is it evidence that this case is still pending. It only
Shows that the application or petition was filed on the date shown.

HtMScaseisanl-133Peﬁﬁon - Filing and approval of a Form 1—130, Petition for Alien Relative, is only the first step in
helping a relative immigrate to the United States. The beneficiaries of a petition must wait until a visa number is
available before they can take the next Step to apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent
residence. To best allocate resources, USCIS may wait to process I—130 forms until closer to the time when a visa number
will become available, which may be years after the petition was filed. Nevertheless, USCIS processes I—l30 forms in time
not to delay relatives’ ability to take the next step toward permanent residence once a visa number does become available.
If, before final action on the petition, you decide to withdraw your petition, your family relationship with the
beneficiary ends, or you become a U.S. citizen, call 800—375-5283.

Appﬁcaﬁonsreqmﬁnglﬁomeuks- In some types of cases USCIS requires biometrics. In such cases, USCIS will send you 3 SEPARATE
appointment notice with a specific date, time and place for you to go to a USCIS Application Support Center (ASC) for
biometrics processing. You must WAIT for that separate appointment notice and take it (NOT this receipt notice) to your
ASC appointment along with your photo identification. Acceptable kinds of photo identification are: a passport or national
photo identification issued by your country, a drivers license, a military photo identification, or a state-issued photo
identification card. If you receive more than one ASC appointment notice, even for different cases, take them both to the
first appointment.

This notice does not grant any immigration status or benefit, nor is it evidence that this case is still pending. It only
Shows that the application or petition was filed on the date shown.

HtMScaseisanl-133Peﬁﬁon - Filing and approval of a Form 1—130, Petition for Alien Relative, is only the first step in
helping a relative immigrate to the United States. The beneficiaries of a petition must wait until a visa number is
available before they can take the next Step to apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent
residence. To best allocate resources, USCIS may wait to process I—130 forms until closer to the time when a visa number
will become available, which may be years after the petition was filed. Nevertheless, USCIS processes I—l30 forms in time
not to delay relatives’ ability to take the next step toward permanent residence once a visa number does become available.
If, before final action on the petition, you decide to withdraw your petition, your family relationship with the
beneficiary ends, or you become a U.S. citizen, call 800—375-5283.

Appﬁcaﬁonsreqmﬁnglﬁomeuks- In some types of cases USCIS requires biometrics. In such cases, USCIS will send you 3 SEPARATE
appointment notice with a specific date, time and place for you to go to a USCIS Application Support Center (ASC) for
biometrics processing. You must WAIT for that separate appointment notice and take it (NOT this receipt notice) to your
ASC appointment along with your photo identification. Acceptable kinds of photo identification are: a passport or national
photo identification issued by your country, a drivers license, a military photo identification, or a state-issued photo
identification card. If you receive more than one ASC appointment notice, even for different cases, take them both to the
first appointment.
